      "WTS 506. The WTS Series means a change of concept within the front load towers, as it introduces the new Structural Mode. This Structural Mode does not use the winch to lift the load, but involves lifting the load with the help of a manual or electric hoist. That is, the tower is used as a structure that is all locked to the required working height. Once the tower is raised to this desired height, the load must be raised with the hoist. ",
